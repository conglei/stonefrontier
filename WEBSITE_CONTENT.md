### Philosophy Section

**Heading:** Philosophy

StoneFrontier builds systems where humans and AI work together in a balanced, stable way.

The human brings interpretation, judgment, and meaning.

The AI expands what can be seen by surfacing context and connecting information across different places and moments.

The value comes from this interaction. Each side strengthens the other.

When the system is shaped this way, complexity becomes easier to move through. Information that once felt scattered begins to form clarity. There is more space to think, compare, and understand without feeling overwhelmed or replaced.

The human remains at the center.

The system extends the range of what can be understood at once.

## About Page

**Heading:** About

StoneFrontier explores how humans and AI can work together in a stable and grounded way. The work begins with the belief that understanding is not something to automate away. It is something to support, expand, and deepen.

There is a focus on systems that help people see more of the context around their decisions, connect knowledge across time, and move through complexity without losing clarity or agency.

StoneFrontier is founded by Conglei Shi. The company grows directly out of a long path of working across research and product environments, with a consistent interest in how people make sense of information and how tools can help.

If this direction resonates, we're open to conversation and collaboration.
